### 3. who are the stakeholders?

**The needs of the following groups of people form the goals that any proposed
solution for integrating ES modules must fulfill.**

**JavaScript Users:** This includes anyone who reads or writes JS for fun or
profit, including Node.js users, frontend developers, and developers who
primarily operate in other languages who occasionally find themselves writing
JS. All comfort levels with the language should be taken into account in the
decision making process, from folks who are just starting out, to those that
have been writing JS since its inception.

**Implementors:** This includes the Node.js
[CTC](https://github.com/nodejs/node#current-project-team-members) and
colloborators, but also extends to browser implementors, alternate server-side
JS implementors, tooling implementors *(such as ESLint, Browserify, Webpack, and
Rollup)*, and toolchain implementors for other language ecosystems *(such as
Ruby's Sprockets or PHP's Assetic.)*

**System Administrators:** To the extent that any of the proposed solutions
will affect existing common server administration practices, the needs of
system administrators should be taken into account.

**Specification Authors:** In particular,
[TC39](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).
